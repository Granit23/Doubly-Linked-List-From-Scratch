# Doubly-Linked-List-From-Scratch
Implements a double linked list from scratch. DLL data structure re-written by me. This is a menu driven program that allows the user to simulate what it's like to interact with a doubly linked list by letting the user do things like: 
```
   1. Add a new node to the head
   2. Add a new node to the tail
   3. Delete from head
   4. Delete from tail
   5. Traverse the list reversely
   6. Print value Head points to
   7. Print value Tail points to
   8. Move head to tail
   9. Read in list from file
```

For option 9, I have provided a file for you called "num.dat". You may create your own version of "num.dat" as long as it is named the same.

To run, extract the folder somewhere then open up a terminal in that location and enter these commands in the terminal:

```
   cd Doubly-Linked-List-From-Scratch  
```

Build the program:
```
   make
```

Execute the program:
```
   ./dll
```

Have fun!
