# Doubly-Linked-List-From-Scratch
Implements a double linked list from scratch. Meaning I wrote all of the methods and classes used in the code. A menu driven program that allows the user to simulate what it's like to interact with a doubly linked list by letting the user do things like: 
```
   1. Add a new node to the head
   2. Add a new node to the tail
   3. Delete from head
   4. Delete from tail
   5. Traverse the list reversely
   6. <Extra Credit> Print value Head points to
   7. <Extra Credit> Print value Tail points to
   8. Move head to tail
   9. <Extra Credit 2>: Read in list from file
```

For option 9, I have provided a file for you called "num.dat". You may create your own version of "num.dat" as long as it is named the same.

To run, extract the folder somewhere then open up a terminal in that location and enter these commands in the terminal:

```
   cd Doubly-Linked-List-From-Scratch  
```

Build the program:
```
   make
```

Execute the program:
```
   ./dll
```

Have fun!
