# Doubly-Linked-List-From-Scratch
Implements a double linked list from scratch. Meaning I wrote all of the methods and classes used in the code. A menu driven program that allows the user to simulate what it's like to interact with a doubly linked list by letting the user do things like: 
   
    1. Add a new node to the head
    2. Add a new node to the tail
    3. Delete from head
    4. Delete from tail
    5. Traverse the list reversely
    6. Print value Head points to
    7. Print value Tail points to
    8. Move head to tail
    9. Read in list from file
   
    
    For option 9, an example file, "num.dat" is provided. However you may create your own as long as you name it the same.
    
    To run the program:
